# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Data Scientist** specializing in **Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on **anomaly detection** and **scoring**. My goal is to help businesses leverage the power of their data to enhance decision-making and automate processes.

With a background in industrial engineering and teaching, I have developed a rigorous approach to data, the ability to explain complex concepts clearly, and expertise in cloud tools for deploying models into production.

## 🛠️ Skills & Experience

🔹 **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
🔹 **Data Engineering** (SQL, BigQuery, dbt, dlt, Kestra)  
🔹 **MLOps & Cloud Computing** (AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes)  
🔹 **Development & Automation** (Python, FastAPI, Flask)  
🔹 **Data Visualization & Storytelling** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Looker Studio)  

## 📌 Notable Projects
