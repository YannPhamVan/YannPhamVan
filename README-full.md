# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Data Scientist** specializing in **Machine Learning**, with a strong focus on **scoring**, **anomaly detection**, and **forecasting**.  
I help businesses **industrialize their ML models** and **deliver measurable impact** through robust, production-ready data pipelines.

With a background in **industrial engineering** and **teaching**, I combine a rigorous approach to data, the ability to explain complex concepts clearly, and expertise in **MLOps** for deploying and monitoring models in production.

## 🛠️ Skills & Experience

🔹 **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
🔹 **Data Engineering** (SQL, BigQuery, dbt, dlt, Kestra, Prefect)  
🔹 **MLOps & Cloud Computing** (AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Evidently)  
🔹 **Development & APIs** (Python, FastAPI, Flask, REST)  
🔹 **Business Intelligence & Visualization** (Looker Studio, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  

## 📌 Notable Projects

🌟 **[Industrial Equipment Failure Prediction](https://github.com/YannPhamVan/Industrial-Equipment-Failure-Prediction)**  
➡️ Time-series feature engineering and supervised ML model for predicting industrial equipment failures. Deployed as an API on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

🌟 **[Financial Distress Prediction](https://github.com/YannPhamVan/financial-distress-prediction)**  
➡️ Predicting corporate bankruptcies using classification models, with Flask API deployment and monitoring.

🌟 **[OptiFund: Data-Driven Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/YannPhamVan/OptiFund-Data-Driven-Portfolio-Optimization)**  
➡️ End-to-end data engineering pipeline with Kestra, GCS, BigQuery, dbt, and Looker dashboards for stock index performance analysis.
